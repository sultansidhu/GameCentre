**Communication Tools**
The team will heavily depend on meeting up to get the work done. Remotely, the team will use Facebook messenger to communicate and collaborate. All members have agreed to be present on off-days, and all members have access to Facebook messenger. The team will also use Skype as a way to have group calls when members are not able to be physically present. 

***

**Terms of the team contract**
All team members must comply to the following points. Each team member must:
1. Get the allotted work done on time.
2. Attend every team meeting and actively participate by putting forward ideas.
3. Notify the other team members in case they are unable to attend team meetings.
4. Complete a roughly equal portion of the total work that has been assigned to them.
5. Help the team understand concepts through collectively contemplating the given code.
6. Ask their fellow team members for assistance, in case they feel lost or are unable to understand a concept/block of code.
7. Give input into design ideologies and how code can be made as beautiful and efficient as possible.
8. Work well together with the team to ensure an optimal learning experience.
9. Be polite and kind! 

***

We tackled this project by breaking it down into components/features. For each feature, we will have two sub-teams working on it, consisting of 2-3 people. In the case of 2 people working on a feature, one person shall implement the code, while the other will look up documentation and find solutions on StackOverflow. We will not implement an entire feature individually, since a one-person team is not likely to be able to both implement and debug features. 

*** 

We will have several meetings over the course of this project, and we have designated Abhishek Kapoor (one of our team members) to be the official note taker.
